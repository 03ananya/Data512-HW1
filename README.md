## Screenshots
Plots generated by the code

- **Maximum Average and Minimum Average
This graph contains time series for the articles that have the highest average page requests and the lowest average page requests for desktop access and mobile access



- **Screenshot of plot 2: ** Top 10 Peak Page Views
This graph contains contain time series for the top 10 article pages by largest (peak) page views over the entire time by access type.



- **Screenshot of plot 3: ** Fewest Months of Data
This graph show pages that have the fewest months of available data
